# CAPSTONE-PROJECT 🏖️
 This repo contains Front-end (zip) & Back-end (zip) of my final project for the EPICODE school.
 
 Hello everyone, my final project is a website that allows the reservation of the limited number beaches of Sardinia (Italy). 
 This is a full-stack project developed all by me! In the next paragraph I leave you some information how to start my project from your pc👩🏻‍💻
 
 
# Front-end
• Repository = https://github.com/chiarafais/capstoneFE

• To start the front-end, clone the repository and open with VScode (or another editor) and in the terminal enter the command

# Back-end 
• Repository = https://github.com/chiarafais/capstoneBE

# Database 💾
• In this repository there is a CSV file, it contains the list of beaches with their data.
I recommend using PostgreSQL (among other things) makes csv import easy.
After you start back-end :
gestionalespiagge › Schemas › public › Tables › spiagge
on "spiagge" import/export data---> inside the folder "configuration PostgreSQL CSV" you will find screens on how to set up the import.
